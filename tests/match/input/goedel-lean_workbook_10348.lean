  Given the function \( f : \mathbb{R} \to \mathbb{R} \) and the conditions \( f(x) \leq x \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \) and \( f(x + y) \leq f(x) + f(y) \) for all \( x, y \in \mathbb{R} \), we need to show that \( f(x) = x \) for all \( x \in \mathbb{R} \).
  1. Start by introducing an arbitrary real number \( x \).
  2. Use the second condition \( f(x + y) \leq f(x) + f(y) \) with \( y = x \) to get \( f(x + x) \leq f(x) + f(x) \), which simplifies to \( f(2x) \leq 2f(x) \).
  3. Use the second condition with \( y = -x \) to get \( f(x + (-x)) \leq f(x) + f(-x) \), which simplifies to \( f(0) \leq f(x) + f(-x) \).
  4. Use the first condition \( f(x) \leq x \) and \( f(-x) \leq -x \) to derive additional inequalities.
  5. Combine these inequalities to show that \( f(x) = x \).
