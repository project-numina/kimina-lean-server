  We need to show that for real numbers \(a\), \(b\), and \(c\), the inequality \((a^2 + 2)(b^2 + 2)(c^2 + 2) \geq 9(a b + b c + c a)\) holds. This can be derived using the non-negativity of squares and basic algebraic manipulations. Specifically, we will expand the left-hand side and compare it with the right-hand side. By leveraging the non-negativity of squares, we can establish the inequality.
