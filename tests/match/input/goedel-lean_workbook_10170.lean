  To prove that \(\lfloor \frac{30}{4.5} \rfloor = 6\), we start by simplifying the expression \(\frac{30}{4.5}\). We know that \(4.5\) can be written as \(\frac{9}{2}\). Thus, the expression becomes \(\frac{30}{\frac{9}{2}} = \frac{30 \times 2}{9} = \frac{60}{9} = \frac{20}{3}\).
  Next, we need to determine the floor of \(\frac{20}{3}\). We calculate \(\frac{20}{3} \approx 6.6667\). The floor function \(\lfloor x \rfloor\) returns the greatest integer less than or equal to \(x\). Since \(6.6667\) is approximately 6.6667, the greatest integer less than or equal to \(6.6667\) is 6.
  Thus, we have shown that \(\lfloor \frac{30}{4.5} \rfloor = 6\).
