  To prove that \(2S = k(k+1)\) where \(S = k + (k-1) + \cdots + 1\), we start by expressing \(S\) as a sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers. The sum of the first \(k\) natural numbers is given by the formula \(\frac{k(k+1)}{2}\). We then multiply this sum by 2 to get \(2S\). Simplifying the expression, we find that \(2S = k(k+1)\).
