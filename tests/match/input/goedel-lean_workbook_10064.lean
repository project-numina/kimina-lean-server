  To find all functions \( f(x) \) such that \( f(x) - f(x^3) = \frac{x}{x^2 - 1} \) for \( x > 1 \), we need to determine a function \( f \) that satisfies this equation. We propose that \( f(x) = y + \log(x^2 - 1) \) for some constant \( y \). By substituting this proposed function into the given equation, we can verify that it indeed satisfies the equation.
