  To prove that the maximum value of \(xy + yz + zx\) given \(x, y, z > 0\) and \(x + y + z = 9\) is at most 27, we can use the following steps:
  1. Recognize that the expression \(xy + yz + zx\) can be rewritten in a form that involves squares of differences.
  2. Use the fact that the square of any real number is non-negative to derive inequalities that bound the expression.
  3. Combine these inequalities to show that the expression is at most 27.
