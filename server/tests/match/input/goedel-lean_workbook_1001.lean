/- $ (a^{2}+b^{2})(c^{2}+d^{2}) = (ad-bc)^{2}+(ac+bd)^{2} $ is an identity (that is, it holds for all values of $a$ , $b$ , $c$ , $d$ . In fact, it is a special (two-variable) case of Lagrange's Identity. -/
theorem lean_workbook_1001 {a b c d : â„‚} : (a^2 + b^2) * (c^2 + d^2) = (a * d - b * c)^2 + (a * c + b * d)^2  := by

  We need to show that for any complex numbers \(a\), \(b\), \(c\), and \(d\), the identity \((a^2 + b^2)(c^2 + d^2) = (ad - bc)^2 + (ac + bd)^2\) holds. This identity is a special case of Lagrange's Identity.
  1. Start by expanding the left-hand side of the identity using the distributive property.
  2. Simplify the resulting expression by combining like terms.
  3. Recognize that the simplified expression matches the right-hand side of the identity.
