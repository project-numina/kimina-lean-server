  Given \( u + 2v > 4 \), we aim to show that \( 2uv \leq \frac{u^2 + 4v^2}{2} \). This can be derived using the non-negativity of squares and basic algebraic manipulations. Specifically, we start by considering the square of the difference \( (u - 2v) \), which is non-negative. By expanding and simplifying the expression, we can derive the desired inequality.

  -- Use the non-negativity of the square of the difference (u - 2v) to derive the inequality.
  -- Specifically, we know that (u - 2v)^2 ≥ 0.

  -- The `nlinarith` tactic will automatically handle the algebraic manipulations and inequalities to conclude the proof.
