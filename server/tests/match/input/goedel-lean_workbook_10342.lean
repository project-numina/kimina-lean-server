  To prove the inequality \(\frac{1}{2x+1}+\frac{1}{2y+1}\ge\frac{2}{xy+2}\) for nonnegative reals \(x\) and \(y\), we proceed as follows:
  1. **Simplify the left-hand side**: Combine the fractions \(\frac{1}{2x+1}\) and \(\frac{1}{2y+1}\) over a common denominator.
  2. **Simplify the right-hand side**: Combine the fractions over a common denominator.
  3. **Use algebraic manipulation**: Apply algebraic identities and inequalities to show that the left-hand side is greater than or equal to the right-hand side.
  4. **Apply inequalities**: Use known inequalities such as the AM-GM inequality to establish the desired result.
