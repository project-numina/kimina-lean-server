  Given \( x = \frac{4 - 2\sqrt{3}}{2} \), we need to show that \( x = 2 - \sqrt{3} \). We start by simplifying the expression for \( x \). First, we rewrite the division as a multiplication by the inverse of 2. Then, we simplify the multiplication and use the property of the square root to confirm that \( \sqrt{3} \) is non-negative. Finally, we verify that the expression simplifies to \( 2 - \sqrt{3} \).
