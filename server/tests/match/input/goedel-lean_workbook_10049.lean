  To show that the equation \( x^4 + x^3 - x + 1 = 0 \) does not have any real solutions, we proceed as follows:
  1. Assume for contradiction that there exists a real number \( x \) such that \( x^4 + x^3 - x + 1 = 0 \).
  2. Consider the expression \( x^2 + x - 1 \). Since the square of any real number is non-negative, \( (x^2 + x - 1)^2 \geq 0 \).
  3. Expanding \( (x^2 + x - 1)^2 \) and using the fact that it is non-negative, we can derive a contradiction with the equation \( x^4 + x^3 - x + 1 = 0 \).
